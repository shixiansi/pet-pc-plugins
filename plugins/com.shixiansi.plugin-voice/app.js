// The voice plugin's front end (1.0.0).
//
// It is a plain module in a sandboxed iframe: its only channel to the outside
// world is `postMessage` to its parent, using the bridge protocol (ready / init /
// request / response / event). There is deliberately no fetch, no storage API and
// no file access of its own - every capability goes through the host program that
// mounted it.
//
// ONE document serves TWO appearances, and `applyView` is the single place that
// decides which one:
//
//   surface.slot === 'background'   the pet's headless frame. No interface: it
//                                   subscribes to the timer and reminder events
//                                   and plays a clip. THIS is what makes the
//                                   plugin work while no panel is open.
//   surface.slot === 'workshop'     the workshop, hosted by the plugin market
//                                   program in this plugin's settings area.
//
// The host program differs between the two (the pet mounts the headless frame,
// the market mounts the workshop), so the plugin must never assume which
// capabilities are available: it asks, and a refusal is a normal answer. For
// example `todos.list` exists in the pet and not in the market.
